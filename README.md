"# Myquiz1"

This app was developed in Android Studio using Kotlin. It is a flashcard-style quiz app designed to help users test their knowledge of South African history. The app consists of three screens: a welcome screen, a quiz screen, and a result screen. It uses two parallel arrays  one for storing five True/False questions and another for their correct answers. As users select their answers, the app provides immediate feedback "Correct!" or "Incorrect" and updates the score accordingly. The final screen displays the total score, gives motivational feedback, and allows users to review all the questions with their correct answers. The interface is clean and easy to use, guiding users clearly from start to finish. GitHub is used for version control, with GitHub Actions to automate building and testing. Logging helps monitor the app's behavior and troubleshoot any issues during development.
